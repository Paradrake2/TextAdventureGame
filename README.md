This contains the logic for the text game. I'm making this as a fun experiment and as a way to learn new skills, do not expect the cleanest code here. If you are a recruiter or considering me for a job, hello, hi, this is an example of my skillset. Please hire me :)
This is a text adventure game based around crafting. You kill enemies and use their dropped materials to make weapons and armor. Currently it has:

equipment: WORKING, MORE CONTENT COMING

monsters: WORKING, MORE CONTENT COMING

leveling system: WORKING

story: IN PROGRESS

combat: basics are working, can kill stuff, havent added anything else like healing or special attacks yet

crafting: IN PROGRESS

raw sex appeal: henry cavill level

NOTES FOR MYSELF: Need to add instructions for user, finish crafting system. Eventually maybe add a shop system???
